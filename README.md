# WorldStudios-Big-Java-Modpack
Currently, the mods in this modpack support Minecraft 1.21.4 (NeoForge 21.4.123).

This modpack contains all of the addons I've ever made for Minecraft Java. he point of this modpack is so you can have both essential and unnecessary things in your world(s), ranging from a cow creeper to a brand-new dimension.

Due to MCreator's limitations, I can only use NeoForge as the loader for this modpack, so I'm sorry if you don't use NeoForge.
